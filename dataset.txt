This file that I am planning to analyze consists of results football(soccer) games since 1872 to 2017
There are 3 datasets available in this the results the goal sccorers and the shootouts.

  We could potentially analyze who was the top goal scorer and what was the mean time at which 
  goals were scored.

  Another option that we can pursue is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales
  This dataset talks about video games sales and which publisher,genre, year, video game had the best sales
    across, North america, Japan, europe and worldwide.

      We can plot the sales on a graph using adot plot the way we did in hw6 and analyze the shape of the graph 
      based on the mean and standard deviation of the results.
